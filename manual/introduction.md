# Introduction

The `badger` toolkit provides a range of classes and utility
functions for server-side Javascript using Node.js.

There is no particular rhyme or reason as to what's included
or excluded from the toolkit.  It contains the kind of things
that I've found to be useful to help build and maintain
non-trivial software projects.

## Warning

Please note that it is *opinionated* and *selfish* software.

It is *opiniated* because it (generally speaking) only implements one way
to do something.  It's the way that I think is best (or least bad) and
aims to please one person (me) most of the time, rather than providing
countless configuration options to try and please all the people all
the time.

It is *selfish* because I wrote it to make my own life easier and to
simplify and expediate the process of writing software for myself and
my clients.  You're welcome to use it, but please be warned that after 25+
years of writing, maintaining and supporting Open Source software, I no
longer have the time or inclination to provide free support for other
people.

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for a way it can be improved
then please feel free to raise an issue and/or submit a pull request
for a patch to fix the problem or add a new feature.  But don't be
surprised if I don't jump to apply it if it doesn't provide something
that I personally find useful.
