# Introduction

The `badger` toolkit provides a range of classes and utility
functions for server-side Javascript using Node.js.

There is no particular rhyme or reason as to what's included
or excluded from the toolkit.  It contains the kind of things
that I've found to be useful to help build and manage
non-trivial software projects.
