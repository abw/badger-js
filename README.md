# badger-js

This is an application toolkit for Javascript projects.  It provides a number of
classes and utility functions to make life easier.

It is loosely based around the [https://github.com/abw/Badger](Badger) toolkit for
Perl.

It was written to help migrate some old Perl projects to Javascript.
