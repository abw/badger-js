## Who Ordered This?

This is an application toolkit for Javascript projects. It provides a number
of classes and utility functions to make life easier when creating and
managing a server-side Node.js Javascript project.

It is loosely based around the [Badger toolkit for Perl](https://github.com/abw/badger)
and was written primarily to help migrate some old Perl projects to Javascript.
